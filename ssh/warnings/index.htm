<h1>SSH Warnings</h1>


<h2>First time check</h2>



The first time you connect to a host, you will be prompted for authenticity of the host. For example:

<pre>
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/demo1 ubuntu@10.0.173.7
The authenticity of host '10.0.173.7 (10.0.173.7)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 8c:b6:eb:65:92:14:93:e2:fc:82:12:b7:50:0b:12:3b.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
</pre>

You can override this needed end user prompt using the <code>StrictHostKeyChecking</code> option.

<pre>
$ ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i demo1 ubuntu@158.85.161.249
...
</pre>

You can also add this to your ~/.ssh/config file.


<h2>Host has changed warning</h2>

If you startup and shutdown virtual instances that use the same IP address, you may receive the following warning when first connecting.

<pre>
$ ssh -i demo1 ubuntu@158.85.161.249
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
63:15:24:43:3a:c9:73:ed:22:61:8e:00:4a:05:20:86.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts:1
RSA host key for 158.85.161.249 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
</pre>

Using the line number from this output, in this case :1, you can delete this line with

<pre>
$ sed -ie 1d ~/.ssh/known_hosts
$ ssh -i demo1 ubuntu@158.85.161.249
</pre>
